# Deprecated repository

I moved away from this method for generating my website, to now use netlify.

Setting up netlify was easy as pie (pelican-quickstart, pip freeze > requirements.txt, and droping a proper .gitignore).
I now only have one commant to use: pelican content for local dev, and git push for publishing to my (now ssl enabled) website.

Easy enough for me!

PS: If you are looking for my old tox.ini file, check this repository's history.
